        "title": "ChatGPT Follow-up Assistant",
        "excerpt":"Snapshot  ChatGPT Follow-Up Assistant is a Chrome extension I developed to enhance my own learning and productivity with ChatGPT. The extension helps users collect, manage, and export follow-up questions during ChatGPT conversations, making complex discussions more organized and efficient.                                                                                          ChatGPT Follow-Up Assistant Extension       Problem &amp; Motivation   Learning with ChatGPT’s Limitations   While using ChatGPT for research and learning, I frequently encountered the need to ask follow-up questions based on information in long responses. However, I’d often forget questions that came to mind while reading through lengthy AI-generated content. By the time I finished reading, I’d either forget my questions entirely or struggle to phrase them with proper context.   The Context Problem   ChatGPT conversations can grow complex quickly, and maintaining context across multiple questions becomes challenging. I needed a way to capture follow-up questions in the moment, without interrupting my reading flow, and then revisit them with their full context later in the conversation.   Personal Tool That Became Public   I initially built this extension for my personal use as a learning aid. After seeing how much it improved my own workflow, I decided to polish it and publish it for others who might benefit from the same functionality.   Key Features   Seamless Question Collection   The extension allows users to select any text from a ChatGPT response and instantly add it as a follow-up question with a single click. This makes it easy to capture thoughts or questions exactly when they occur during reading, without interrupting the learning flow.                                                    Follow-up Question Management Interface       Organized Question Management   All captured follow-up questions remain visible in a dedicated sidebar panel, making it easy to review, edit, or reorganize them. Users can prioritize questions, delete irrelevant ones, and maintain a clear structure for their ongoing conversation.   One-Click Question Export   With a single click, users can export their collected follow-up questions back into the ChatGPT conversation, allowing for a more structured and thorough exploration of complex topics. This creates a smoother conversation flow and ensures no important questions are forgotten.   Multilingual Support   The extension supports both English and Korean language templates, making it accessible to a wider audience. This bilingual capability was important to me as a Korean developer working with English content.   Privacy-Focused Design   Built with privacy as a priority, the extension operates entirely on the client side with no external server dependencies. All data remains in the user’s browser, ensuring conversations and questions stay private and secure.   Technical Implementation   Tech Stack     Frontend: JavaScript, HTML/CSS   Browser API: Chrome Extension API   Storage: Chrome Storage API   UX Design: Custom CSS, Responsive Design   Extension Architecture   The extension was designed with a lightweight architecture that integrates seamlessly with the ChatGPT web interface. It uses DOM manipulation to identify and interact with ChatGPT elements, mutation observers to detect changes in the conversation, and custom UI components that match ChatGPT’s aesthetic.   User Experience Considerations   I focused heavily on creating a non-intrusive interface that complements rather than disrupts the ChatGPT experience. The extension adds functionality without overwhelming the user or cluttering the interface, maintaining a clean and intuitive workflow.   Development Process   This project began as a personal tool to solve my own pain point when studying with ChatGPT. I iterated through several designs based on my own usage patterns before refining it for public release. The development process included extensive testing with various conversation styles to ensure compatibility with different ChatGPT use cases.   User Feedback &amp; Impact   Since publishing on the Chrome Web Store, the extension has received positive feedback from researchers, students, and professionals who use ChatGPT for complex learning tasks. Users particularly appreciate how it helps maintain context in technical discussions and educational explorations.   Resources      Chrome Web Store Listing  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Manufacturing Company ERP",
        "excerpt":"Snapshot  This custom ERP system was developed as a comprehensive web application for a manufacturing company based in Busan, South Korea. Secured through an international outsourcing contract, the system provides integrated management of production processes, inventory control, and business operations exclusively for internal company use.                                                                                          Manufacturing Company ERP       Industry Challenges   Enterprise Solutions in Small Manufacturing   Small to mid-sized manufacturing firms face significant obstacles with traditional ERP systems. These companies typically operate with limited administrative staff but still require comprehensive process management. Commercial ERP platforms are prohibitively expensive, excessively complex, and filled with unnecessary features that create implementation barriers.   Need for Customized Workflows   Manufacturing operations in South Korea have unique regulatory requirements and specific production workflows that off-the-shelf solutions fail to address. Without tailored systems, companies resort to inefficient manual processes, spreadsheet workarounds, and disconnected data silos that hinder productivity and reporting accuracy.   AI Integration Opportunities   The client identified AI integration as a strategic priority to enhance decision-making capabilities. Predictive maintenance, inventory optimization, and production forecasting were key areas where machine learning could deliver operational advantages that would differentiate them from competitors still using traditional management methods.   Key Features   Production &amp; Quality Control Tracking   Implemented a comprehensive tracking system that manages production and receiving logs with integrated barcode scanning capabilities. The system enables real-time defect identification, root cause analysis, and production line monitoring through an intuitive interface. Quality control managers can instantly generate performance reports and identify recurring issues, reducing defect rates by 23% within four months.   Streamlined Supplier Integration   Developed a secure supplier portal that eliminates paper-based processes and manual data entry. External suppliers now upload inventory manifests directly through a dedicated interface, which automatically integrates with the ERP system. This innovation reduced processing time by 78% and virtually eliminated transcription errors that previously plagued the receiving process.                                                                                          Production Log Management       Automated Certification System   Designed an automated certification generation system that produces standardized quality assurance documents required by downstream customers. The system dynamically creates certificates based on production data, allowing export to PDF, Excel, or direct sharing via secure AWS S3 presigned URLs.
