<!-- # From Solo Work to Team Player: My Co-op Journey -->

<!-- ((overview)) -->

<!-- I have been working as Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad` for 7 months now. 
I am working within a team of 4 people where are responsible for building multiple plattform libraries and frameworks 
to provide call & audio/video functionality. Most of us are working remotely but our team is engaging with each other alot.
It means we have lots chance to collaborate with other product teams. 

Based on my experience and advide of my seniors, I have been sharing -->

<!-- 
why this is better writing 

Stronger opening: Started with your learning experience rather than just stating facts
Emphasis on feedback: Highlighted that you received "crucial feedback from your seniors" about effective teamwork
Clear value proposition: Made it clear that you'll be sharing practical insights and strategies
Better flow: Connected your Dialpad experience directly to the lessons you want to share
Engaging hook: Added "This feedback has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected" to create curiosity

 -->

During my 7 months as a Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad`, I've learned invaluable lessons about `effective team collaboration`. Working within a 4-person team responsible for building multi-platform libraries and frameworks for call & audio/video functionality has given me unique insights into remote teamwork dynamics.

What makes our team particularly effective is how we engage with each other despite being mostly remote. Through constant collaboration with other product teams and within our team, I've received crucial feedback from my seniors and learned about what truly makes teams work well together. This feedback and learning has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected.

In this post, I want to share the key insights and feedback I've received about team collaboration.

<!--  

get feedback often about code and design before go further ( even before PR up)
ask fast question 
no work in silo 
not stupid question

ask question if cannot udnerstand anytime even in the meeting
make understand clear in the meeting by asking question rather than writing down 

tailor my messaged depending on listener 

we all learner 
- comments in pr does not mean you are wrong. 
- give some topic to discuss

## 1. Seek Feedback Early and Often

<!-- Original: One of the most valuable lessons I learned is to **get feedback on code and design before moving forward a lot** - even before creating a pull request. -->
One of the most valuable lessons I learned is to *seek feedback on code and design early and often* - even before creating a pull request.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar ("moving forward a lot" → "early in the process") and improved clarity -->

<!-- Original: As co-op, I thought giving good impression that I have good technical skill and problem solving ability is more important than anything. But most seniors does not have expectation about that to junior. -->
As a co-op student, I initially thought that demonstrating strong technical skills and problem-solving abilities was most important. However, I discovered that seniors don't expect co-op to excel primarily in these areas.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar ("As co-op" → "As a co-op student"), improved sentence structure, and clarified the contrast -->

<!-- Original: High level tasks are not given to junior. Furthermore, it is way faster to solve even low level tasks by seniors who already busy with other tasks rather than giving to junior. -->
Complex tasks aren't typically assigned to co-op, and even simple tasks can often be completed faster by busy seniors than co-op who work on just one task.
<!-- Better: Improved grammar and clarity, combined redundant sentences into one coherent thought -->

<!-- Original: Senior give task to co-op to train and confirm that if this co-op student can work as team member in future. In order to do that, we need to learn two things -->
Seniors assign tasks to co-op to train and confirm that if this co-op student can work as team member in future. In order to do that, we need to learn two things:
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar, improved sentence structure, and created better flow to the list -->

1. **Solving problems efficiently through collaboration skills**
2. **Understanding the codebase, tech stack, and team conventions**

<!-- Original: We mention first thing here which is more important than anything. In order to do that, we need to get feedback often about code and design before go further ( even before PR up) -->
The first skill - `collaboration` - is arguably more critical than technical prowess. This is why seeking frequent feedback on code and design decisions before moving forward is essential.
<!-- Better: Clearer connection between ideas, better grammar, and more professional tone -->

This collaborative approach has transformed my workflow:

1. **Share approach early**: Discuss design decisions before investing significant implementation time
2. **Break down tasks**: Divide work into manageable, reviewable chunks  
3. **Implement incrementally**: Build small pieces that can be easily reviewed
4. **Seek quick feedback**: Get input on each chunk before proceeding
5. **Refactor based on input**: Incorporate feedback promptly
6. **Iterate rapidly**: Move to the next task and repeat the cycle

<!-- Original: This proactive approach saves time and prevents major rework later in the development cycle. Also we can good reputation to show how well tasks is going. -->
This proactive approach not only saves time and *prevents major rework later*, but also helps build a strong reputation by demonstrating consistent progress and collaborative skills.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar ("Also we can good reputation" → clearer sentence), improved flow and professionalism -->

## 2. Ask Questions Without Hesitation

My seniors emphasized that **there are no stupid questions** in a collaborative environment. Here's what I've learned about effective questioning:

### In Meetings

**Ask questions immediately**

<!-- Original: No developer know everything. Ask question immediately if you don't understand something, even during meetings. Don't let confusion accumulate; address it when it happens. If you are in big meeting, leave question in chat. This is good for understanding and give impression to seniors that you are active participant. -->
*No developer knows everything*. Ask questions immediately if you don't understand something, even during meetings. Don't let confusion accumulate; address it when it happens. If you're in a large meeting, post your question in chat. This demonstrates active engagement and leaves a positive impression on seniors.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar (know→knows, question→questions), improved sentence structure, and made the advice more actionable -->

**Prioritize understanding over note-taking**

<!-- Original: At the begginig, I wrote down alot during the meeting to catch up new tech terms to study later myself. It was wrong because of three reasons. -->
Initially, I wrote down extensive notes during meetings to capture new technical terms for later study. This approach was counterproductive for three key reasons:
<!-- Better: Fixed spelling (begginig→Initially), grammar (alot→extensive notes), and improved sentence flow -->

<!-- Original: 1. It gave base imporession not to engage in the meeting. 2. because not engaing, even it is not hard to recall (emaning not put in my head well) 3. It was harder to udnersstand tech term propelry without context. -->
1. **It created the impression of disengagement** during the meeting
2. **Poor retention**: Without active engagement, information wasn't properly absorbed or retained
3. **Lack of context**: Technical terms were much harder to understand when studied in isolation later
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar and spelling errors, improved clarity, and made each point more concise and impactful -->

<!-- Original: Rather than writing down, I try to understand and ask question if I cannot understand in the meeting. It give better impression and memorable for me. -->
Instead of extensive note-taking, I now *focus on understanding concepts in real-time* and asking questions when something isn't clear. This approach is both more impressive to colleagues and more effective for learning.
<!-- Better: Improved grammar (question→questions, It give→This approach), better sentence structure, and clearer cause-and-effect relationship -->

### Work & Tasks

<!-- Original: In agile, you get assigned ticket to do. Sometime it is not clear what to do. Ask question to seniors to make sure you understand what to do and what is expected from you. -->
In agile environments, you'll receive assigned tickets that sometimes lack clear requirements. Always ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand both the task objectives and the expected deliverables before beginning work.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar (Sometime→sometimes, question→questions), improved clarity, and made the advice more specific and actionable --> 

## 3. Tailor Your Communication

In my role, I participate in four distinct types of meetings, each requiring different communication approaches:
<!-- Better: More professional introduction and clearer setup for the list -->

- **Daily Standup**: Share progress and blockers within our core 4-person team
- **Weekly One-on-One**: Discuss progress and career development with my manager  
- **Cross-Product Meetings**: Collaborate with other product teams like iOS and Android
- **Division All-Hands**: Share updates with the broader engineering division

Each audience has different information needs and technical backgrounds. For instance, managers need high-level progress updates rather than detailed implementation specifics. Through experience, I've learned to *tailor my communication style based on the audience*:
<!-- Better: Fixed "AI've" typo, improved grammar, and made the contrast clearer -->

- **With fellow developers**: Share technical implementation details, code architecture decisions, and specific challenges
- **With managers**: Focus on project timeline, business impact, and any blockers that need escalation
- **With cross-functional teams**: Emphasize integration points, dependencies, and how our work affects their deliverables
- **In large meetings**: Keep updates concise and relevant to the broader audience's interests
<!-- Better: More specific and actionable advice, better organized, and expanded with practical examples -->

You could adapt this approach to your own needs and audience. But it's important to tailour your message to the audience's background and interests.

## 4. Embrace a Learning Mindset

Perhaps the most important insight is that **we are all learners**, regardless of experience level:

### Viewing PR Comments Positively

<!-- Original: When I got comments at PR in the beginning, I thought it means I am wrong. But it's not. Our seniors said it's opportunity to open conversation and learn from each other. -->
When I first received comments on my pull requests, I assumed they meant I had made mistakes. However, my seniors explained that *these comments are actually opportunities to start conversations and learn from one another*.
<!-- Better: Fixed grammar ("at PR" → "on my pull requests", "it means" → "they meant"), improved sentence structure and clarity -->

<!-- Original: It changed my mindset and I started to view PR comments positively. We can learn from each other and it's opportunity to improve our code and design. -->
This perspective shift completely changed how I approach code reviews. Now I view PR feedback as valuable learning exchanges where we can improve both our code quality and design decisions together.
<!-- Better: Better transition, fixed grammar ("it's opportunity" → "valuable learning exchanges"), more engaging language -->

### Contributing to Team Learning

We can contribute to team learning by bringing topics for discussion to team meetings, sharing interesting problems we've encountered or solutions we've discovered, and creating an environment where everyone can learn from each other.

## Conclusion

These strategies have not only improved my communication skills but also strengthened my relationships with team members. The key is remembering that *effective teamwork is built on open communication, continuous learning, and mutual support*.
