# How to Work as Team
<!-- ((overview)) -->
<!-- I have been working as Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad` for 7 months now. 
I am working within a team of 4 people where are responsible for building multiple plattform libraries and frameworks 
to provide call & audio/video functionality. Most of us are working remotely but our team is engaging with each other alot.
It means we have lots chance to collaborate with other product teams. 

Based on my experience and advide of my seniors, I have been sharing -->


<!-- 
why this is better writing 

Stronger opening: Started with your learning experience rather than just stating facts
Emphasis on feedback: Highlighted that you received "crucial feedback from your seniors" about effective teamwork
Clear value proposition: Made it clear that you'll be sharing practical insights and strategies
Better flow: Connected your Dialpad experience directly to the lessons you want to share
Engaging hook: Added "This feedback has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected" to create curiosity

During my 7 months as a Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad`, I've learned invaluable lessons about effective team collaboration. Working within a 4-person team responsible for building multi-platform libraries and frameworks for call & audio/video functionality has given me unique insights into remote teamwork dynamics.

What makes our team particularly effective is how we engage with each other despite being mostly remote. Through constant collaboration with other product teams and within our team, I've received crucial feedback from my seniors and learned about what truly makes teams work well together. This feedback and learning has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected.

In this post, I want to share the key insights and feedback I've received about team collaboration, particularly focusing on practical strategies that have transformed how I work with others.

good reputation ? 
- show work = show PR 
= split task = fast feedback 

get feedback about code and design before go further 

ask question if cannot udnerstand anytime even in the meeting

make understand clear in the meeting by asking question rather than writing down 

tailor my messaged depending on listener 

(rick)
Business Develop Mindset 
- pattern matching: design pattern, convention within team 
- incremental development

(rick)
technial skill 
- design 
- OS / algorith 
algorith: underline implmemntation  or optimize  > image future scenario to use this feature
eg. avoid to use 'string' slow > use enum 

(rick)
good code at production level
- no creash 
- work well
- matching codebase 
- documenation / testing
