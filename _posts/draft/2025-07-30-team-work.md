# How to Work as Team

<!-- ((overview)) -->

<!-- I have been working as Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad` for 7 months now. 
I am working within a team of 4 people where are responsible for building multiple plattform libraries and frameworks 
to provide call & audio/video functionality. Most of us are working remotely but our team is engaging with each other alot.
It means we have lots chance to collaborate with other product teams. 

Based on my experience and advide of my seniors, I have been sharing -->

<!-- 
why this is better writing 

Stronger opening: Started with your learning experience rather than just stating facts
Emphasis on feedback: Highlighted that you received "crucial feedback from your seniors" about effective teamwork
Clear value proposition: Made it clear that you'll be sharing practical insights and strategies
Better flow: Connected your Dialpad experience directly to the lessons you want to share
Engaging hook: Added "This feedback has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected" to create curiosity

 -->

During my 7 months as a Software Developer Co-op at `Dialpad`, I've learned invaluable lessons about effective team collaboration. Working within a 4-person team responsible for building multi-platform libraries and frameworks for call & audio/video functionality has given me unique insights into remote teamwork dynamics.

What makes our team particularly effective is how we engage with each other despite being mostly remote. Through constant collaboration with other product teams and within our team, I've received crucial feedback from my seniors and learned about what truly makes teams work well together. This feedback and learning has shaped my understanding of collaboration in ways I never expected.

In this post, I want to share the key insights and feedback I've received about team collaboration.

<!--  

get feedback often about code and design before go further ( even before PR up)
ask fast question 
no work in silo 
not stupid question

ask question if cannot udnerstand anytime even in the meeting
make understand clear in the meeting by asking question rather than writing down 

tailor my messaged depending on listener 

we all learner 
- comments in pr does not mean you are wrong. 
- give some topic to discuss 


-->

## 1. Seek Feedback Early and Often

One of the most valuable lessons I learned is to **get feedback on code and design before moving forward a lot** - even before creating a pull request. 
As co-op, I thought giving good impression that I have good technical skill and problem solving ability 
is more important than anything. But most seniors does not have expectation about that to junior. 
High level tasks are not given to junior. Furthermore, it is way faster to solve even low level tasks by seniors who already busy with other tasks rather than giving to junior. 

Senior give task to co-op to train and confirm that if this co-op student can 
work as team member in future. In order to do that, we need to learn two things
1. how to sovle problem fast using collaboration skills
2. getting better udnerstading with code base and tech stack, conventions.

We mention first thing here  which is more important than anything. 
In order to do that, we need to get feedback often about code and design before go further ( even before PR up)

This approach has completely changed how I work:

1. Share your approach and design decisions early before spending lots time to implement in detail
2. Divide task
3. Implementation
4. Ask for quick feedback with small chunk
5. Refactor 
6. go to next task 
7. repeat fast

This proactive approach saves time and prevents major rework later in the development cycle.
Also we can good reputation to show how well tasks is going.

## 2. Ask Questions Without Hesitation

My seniors emphasized that **there are no stupid questions** in a collaborative environment. Here's what I've learned about effective questioning:

### In Meetings

- **Ask questions immediately** if you don't understand something, even during meetings
- **Prioritize understanding over note-taking** - it's better to clarify in the moment than to work with wrong assumptions
- Don't let confusion accumulate; address it when it happens

### Daily Work

- Ask quick questions to avoid working in isolation
- **Never work in a silo** - staying connected with your team is crucial for both personal growth and project success

## 3. Tailor Your Communication

Different team members have different communication preferences and expertise levels. I've learned to **adapt my message depending on the listener**:

- Use technical details with fellow developers
- Focus on business impact when talking to product managers
- Adjust complexity based on the recipient's background and current context

## 4. Embrace a Learning Mindset

Perhaps the most important insight is that **we are all learners**, regardless of experience level:

### Viewing PR Comments Positively

- **Comments in pull requests don't mean you're wrong** - they're opportunities for improvement and learning
- Each review is a chance to learn from your teammates' experience and perspectives

### Contributing to Team Learning

- **Bring topics for discussion** to team meetings
- Share interesting problems you've encountered or solutions you've discovered
- Create an environment where everyone can learn from each other

These collaboration strategies have not only improved my technical skills but also strengthened my relationships with team members. The key is remembering that effective teamwork is built on open communication, continuous learning, and mutual support.
